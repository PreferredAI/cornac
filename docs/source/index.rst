Cornac: a collection of recommendation algorithms and comparisons
=================================================================

**Cornac** is python recommender systems library for **easy**, **effective** and **efficient** experiments. Cornac is **simple** and **handy**. It is designed from the ground-up to faithfully reflect the standard steps taken by researchers to implement and evaluate personalized recommendation models. Moreover, contributing new recommender models, evaluation metrics, etc., to Cornac is very easy and smooth. For instance, if you already have a python implementation of your model, e.g., PMF, you will need to spend less than 5 minutes in average to integrate it to Cornac.
